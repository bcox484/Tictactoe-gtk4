# Tictactoe-gtk4
Tic tac toe in a gtk4 window

Run 'make' inside the project directory to compile the project, must have gtk4 installed for this to work.

To be able to view all of the images in the gtk window you must either run the executable from inside the project directory,
or change the file paths in src/tictactactoe.c and src/tictactoe.ui to explicit paths, and run resource-compile.sh before recompiling.
